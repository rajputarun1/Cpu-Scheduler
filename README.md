# CPU Scheduling Simulator
A comprehensive web-based tool for visualizing and analyzing CPU scheduling algorithms in operating systems.

## Overview
The CPU Scheduling Simulator provides an interactive platform to demonstrate how different scheduling algorithms allocate processor time to processes. It offers real-time visualization through Gantt charts and calculates key performance metrics to facilitate algorithm comparison.

## Key Features
### Scheduling Algorithms
- First Come First Serve (FCFS) : Simple queue-based scheduling based on arrival order
- Shortest Job First (SJF) : Minimizes waiting time by prioritizing shorter processes
- Priority Scheduling : Executes processes based on assigned priority values
- Round Robin : Ensures fairness using time slices with configurable quantum
### Interactive Process Management
- Dynamic process creation and modification
- Contextual input fields that adapt to the selected algorithm
- Drag-and-drop process reordering
### Visual Analysis Tools
- Color-coded Gantt chart visualization
- Process execution timeline
- Automatic metrics calculation
### Performance Metrics
- Average Waiting Time
- Average Turnaround Time
- CPU Utilization Rate
- Throughput
## Implementation
The simulator is built using standard web technologies:

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for responsive styling
- Vanilla JavaScript for algorithm implementation and visualization

## Usage Guide
1. Add processes with their parameters (name, arrival time, burst time, priority)
2. Select a scheduling algorithm
3. Configure algorithm-specific settings (e.g., time quantum for Round Robin)
4. Run the simulation to view the Gantt chart and performance metrics
5. Compare results across different algorithms
## Example Scenario
For a workload with three processes:

- Process A: Arrival at 0ms, Burst time of 5ms
- Process B: Arrival at 2ms, Burst time of 3ms
- Process C: Arrival at 4ms, Burst time of 1ms
The FCFS algorithm produces:

- Execution order: A → B → C
- Average Waiting Time: 2.67ms
- Average Turnaround Time: 6ms
## Future Development
- Implementation of preemptive scheduling variants
- Multi-level queue scheduling
- Process priority aging mechanisms
- Simulation speed controls
- Data export capabilities
This simulator serves as both an educational tool for understanding operating system concepts and a practical utility for analyzing scheduling algorithm performance under various workloads.
